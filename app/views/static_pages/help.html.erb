<h3>Thesis upload help guide</h3>
<br/>
<h4>Uploading your file(s)</h4>


<p>
  The dissertation you upload must be the final version after it has been marked. Files can be dragged and dropped onto the green box labelled ‘drop files here’, or you can use the ‘Choose files’ button to add files via a browse window. You can add as many files as you wish, but please bear the following guidance in mind.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  Your dissertation main text should be uploaded as a single file (e.g. not a separate file for each chapter). You can upload appendices as additional files.
  </li>
  <li>
  We would strongly prefer PDF as the format for your main dissertation text and the uploader requires you to upload a PDF  as the main text. If there are strong reasons why PDF is not a suitable format (e.g. it contains interactive elements within the body of the dissertation), please get in touch with us (<a href="mailto:dlib-info@york.ac.uk">dlib-info@york.ac.uk</a>) and we will make arrangements to upload your dissertation.
  </li>
  <li>
  Do not upload any files that were not part of your submission for marking.
  </li>
</ol>
<br/>
Once you have uploaded your files and they appear in the ‘uploaded files’ box, select which file is your main dissertation text by checking the ‘main’ radio button beneath it. (This will only appear under PDF files). If you do not select a main file, you will be prompted to do so before the files will upload to the Digital Library.
