    <h3>York Digital Library Batch Ingest Tool</h3>
    <p>This tool is for uploading batches of images, dissertations, scholarly texts or exam papers, and their associated files. It can also be used to add batches of collections.</p>

    <p>The tool has two steps. First complete the form and upload your file.
        The tool then checks the data for errors (files not in the specified locations, incorrect column headings and non-existent collections).
        If the data has no significant errors the ingest can then proceed.</p>

    <p>Please avoid any special characters in file names. The short and pithier the better.</p>

    <p>Please <strong>check and double check</strong> your data and the on screen report. It's much easier to correct errors now, than later.</p>

    <h3>Current limitations</h3>

    <p>It can only upload one type of content at a time.</p>
    <p>It can only upload pdf files for Dissertations, Scholarly Texts and Exam Papers (both main and additional files).</p>
    <p>It does not support uploading jpeg images.</p>
    <p>It will not upload files with Collections.</p>
